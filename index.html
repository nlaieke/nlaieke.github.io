    <h1><em>American Anti-Racism Alliance Pledge</em></h1>
    <p id="agreetext"> Mindful of the continuing affliction of personal, institutional, and structural racism, and of the daily realities of all forms of prejudice and bigotry in my own life and in the lives of my family, friends, co-workers, and the society in which I live, it is with conviction and hope that I take this pledge. <br><br>

    I am fully aware that the struggle to eliminate racism will not end with a mere pledge, but this effort needs an anti-racism mindset that calls for an ongoing transformation within myself, within my community, and within the institutions and structures of our society.
